    "A database is a systematic collection of data. It enables the storage, organization, and retrieval of data in various formats. There are two main types of databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases: These are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. They are table-based and follow a predefined schema. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases: These are non-relational databases that do not require a fixed schema. They are designed to store and manage large sets of unstructured data. NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases. \n",
