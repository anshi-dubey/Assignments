    "Statistics is the study of data collection, analysis, perception, introduction, and organization. It is a method of gathering and summarizing results. Statistics is the branch of mathematics that is all about the gathering, observing, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In simpler words, it is a field to collect and summarize data."

    "\n",
    "Knowing the level of measurement of your variables is important for two reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------The First reason is --------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the levels of measurement provides a different level of detail.  Nominal provides the least amount of detail, ordinal provides the next highest amount of detail, and interval and ratio provide the most amount of detail.\n",
    "-----------For example, ----------\n",
    "In a nominal level variable, values are grouped into categories that have no meaningful order.  For example, gender and Members in the group are assigned a label in that group and there is no hierarchy.Typical descriptive statistics associated with nominal data are frequencies and percentages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal level variables are nominal level variables with a meaningful order.  For example, horse race winners can be assigned labels of first, second, third, fourth, etc. and these labels have an ordered relationship among them (i.e., first is higher than second, second is higher than third, and so on).  As with nominal level variables, ordinal level variables are typically described with frequencies and percentages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval and ratio level variables (also called continuous level variables) have the most detail associated with them.  Mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be accurately applied to the values of these variables.  An example variable would be the amount of milk used in cookie recipe (measured in cups).  This variable has arithmetic properties such that 2 cups of milk is exactly twice as much as 1 cup of milk.  Additionally, the difference between 1 and 2 cups of milk is exactly the same as the difference between 2 and 3 cups of milk.  Interval and ratio level variables are typically described using means and standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------The Second reason is--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "because different statistical tests are appropriate for variables with different levels of measurement. \n",
    "-----------For example, ----------\n",
    "chi-square tests of independence are most appropriate for nominal level data.  The Mann-Whitney U test is most appropriate for an ordinal level dependent variable and a nominal level independent variable.  An ANOVA is most appropriate for a continuous level dependent variable and a nominal level independent variable.  To learn which tests use what types of variable, please download the free whitepaper."

    "Central tendency is the name for measurements that look at the typical central values within a dataset. This does not just refer to the central value within an entire dataset, which is called the median. Rather, it is a general term used to describe a variety of central measurements. For instance, it might include central measurements from different quartiles of a larger dataset. Common measures of central tendency include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-->The mean: The average value of all the data points.\n",
    "-->The median: The central or middle value in the dataset.\n",
    "-->The mode: The value that appears most often in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The variability, or dispersion, of a dataset, describes how values are distributed or spread out. Identifying variability relies on understanding the central tendency measurements of a dataset. However, like central tendency, variability is not just one measure. It is a term used to describe a range of measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Common measures of variability include are: \n",
    "\n",
    "-->Standard deviation: This shows us the amount of variation or dispersion. Low standard deviation implies that most values are close to the mean. High standard deviation suggests that the values are more broadly spread out.\n",
    "-->Minimum and maximum values: These are the highest and lowest values in a dataset or quartile. Using the example of our hair color dataset again, the minimum and maximum values are 13 and 130 respectively.\n",
    "Range: This measures the size of the distribution of values. This can be easily determined by subtracting the smallest value from the largest. So, in our hair color dataset, the range is 117 (130 minus 13).\n",
    "-->Kurtosis: This measures whether or not the tails of a given distribution contain extreme values (also known as outliers). If a tail lacks outliers, we can say that it has low kurtosis. If a dataset has a lot of outliers, we can say it has high kurtosis.\n",
    "-->Skewness: This is a measure of a dataset’s symmetry. If you were to plot a bell-curve and the right-hand tail was longer and fatter, we would call this positive skewness. If the left-hand tail is longer and fatter, we call this negative skewness. This is visible in the following image.\n"
