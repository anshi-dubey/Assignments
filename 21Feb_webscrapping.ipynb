    "Q2. What are the different methods used for Web Scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:\n",
    "There are several methods used for web scraping, each with its own advantages and limitations. Here are some common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using Libraries and Frameworks**: This involves using programming languages like Python along with libraries and frameworks such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium to automate the process of fetching web pages, extracting data, and parsing HTML/XML structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**: Many websites offer APIs that allow developers to access data in a structured format, making it easier to extract information without needing to parse HTML. However, not all websites provide APIs, and sometimes the available data may be limited compared to what can be accessed through web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Direct HTTP Requests**: This method involves making direct HTTP requests to web servers to retrieve web pages' HTML content. While straightforward, it may not work for websites that use dynamic content loading techniques like AJAX or require authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Browser Automation**: Tools like Selenium WebDriver automate web browsers to interact with web pages just like a human user would. This method is useful for scraping websites with complex JavaScript-based interactions or for handling CAPTCHA challenges. However, it can be slower and resource-intensive compared to other methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Proxy Servers**: When scraping multiple pages from a website, using proxy servers can help avoid IP bans or rate limiting by distributing requests across different IP addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Scraping Services**: There are also scraping services and tools available that offer pre-built scrapers or allow users to configure custom scraping tasks without writing code. These services often provide scalability and reliability but may come with a cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of method depends on factors such as the complexity of the website, the volume of data to be scraped, the required frequency of scraping, and the resources available for development and maintenance."
